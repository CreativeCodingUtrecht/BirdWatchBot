# Connect your BirdNET-Pi to BirdWeather

The following recipe helps you to create a connection from the BirdNET-Pi to [BirdWeather](https://app.birdweather.com).

## Create an account on BirdWeather
First, [create a free account](https://app.birdweather.com/login) on BirdWeather.

You can then [create and manage your own station](https://app.birdweather.com/account/stations). In this process, you'll receive a `BirdWeather ID` that can be used to send BirdNET-Pi observations to Bird Weather.

## Configure the BirdWeather ID on the BirdNET-Pi
In the menu of the BirdNET-Pi web dashboard, click on `Tools`. Then, select `Settings`.

Configure your BirdWeather ID under `BirdWeather`.

When you're ready, make sure to click on `Update Settings` at the bottom of the page.

## Test the connection to BirdWeather
Open [BirdWeather](https://app.birdweather.com/) and search for your own station. 

When you're in a workshop space and don't have real birds available to you, play some bird sound recordings (e.g. from YouTube) near your microphone.
